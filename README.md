# DogAdoptionCenter
 
### Overview
Welcome to the Dog Adoption Center application, a C++ program (created for an Object-Oriented Programming class in college) designed to facilitate the adoption of dogs. This application offers two modes: User and Administrator. In the User mode, potential adopters can browse and adopt dogs, view their images, and apply filters. The Administrator mode allows authorized personnel to manage the dog data, including adding, deleting, and updating information.

### Features
#### User Mode
Browse Dogs: View data and images of dogs available for adoption.
Adoption Process: Select the type of file (CSV or HTML) to save adopted dogs' information.
Filter Dogs: Apply filters based on criteria such as breed, age.
#### Administrator Mode
Add Dogs: Add new dogs to the database with relevant information.
Delete Dogs: Remove dogs from the database.
Update Information: Modify existing data about dogs.

### GUI with Qt
The application provides (beside the console-based interface) a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the Qt framework for a seamless and user-friendly experience.
